This part has been the most impressive, not to mention helpful for me working on a team as a POC female engineer.If you have good standing on your team, you can move around. Try a 6 month bungee to take on a new type of role, switch product teams, etc. In my four years I've worked on 4 teams across 3 PAs in 2 different roles. Additionally, they have programs where you can teach CS full-time at a college for up to a semester (Google will pay for you to live temporarily in a different state), work on a passion project for 20% of your time, teach classes to other Googlers, or work a stint full-time for a non-profit through Google.org. If you're the passionate, exploratory type, the possibilities are endless.",Cons,"Big company problems. The red tape is endless. If you're used to working for smaller companies that move faster with less bureaucracy, the time it takes to do something simple like add a column to a table, let alone launch a feature, can be exasperating.

There is a ton of political infighting as different Directors and VPs fight to build their kingdoms. Teams are built to help create kingdoms, but not enough interesting and good work to go around to give everyone meaningful assignments.

Surprisingly few business areas seem to have leaders who are highly competent in that field and who are motivated to — and expected to — deliver revenue, profit, and growth. Those well-run business areas inside Google are — not surprisingly — Search and Ads, YouTube, Google Cloud Platform, and a handful of others.A number of the other business areas have potential, including motivated, competent, and creative team members at the individual contributor levels. However, the leaders of these business areas seem to have no motivation or incentive to advance or grow the business that they are leading. Google would create much more value by selecting and recruiting leaders with competence and merit-based recognition in their business areas.

Having confidence in your team and colleagues goes extremely far. + Extremely easy to interact with legendary folks like Vint Cerf, Peter Norvig, and others.

Benefits and TC are still great, but if that starts to slack, there might not be much reason for engineers to want to stay...- Your experience will be 80% determined by your team, management, and product area, and 20% determined by what you personally do. Most folks can handle the 20%, but the other 80% is out of control and most bad experiences can be traced to bad leadership.- There's too much of a push to get really strong ICs to take up management, which makes them do bad at both things eventually, or burn out.- GRAD system forever changed our performance management. While our old system was any thing but perfect, we used to say it ""eventually"" guaranteed people were promoted to the right level. Slow? Yes. It was tuned for precision, not for recall. The new system? It's better in a lot of ways, but in aggregate it's fundamentally ripe for worse abuse as it puts bad directors and even toxic bottom tier managers in authoritative positions for people's careers with no check or balance system.- (New) How the layoffs of Jan 2023 were handled has broken the culture internally. Further adding insult to injury, the CEO is reacting to the ChatGPT 'threat' instead of trying to reframe the challenge and creatively think outside the box... Past CEOs would have inspired the company to band together with demo day projects (that would normally be a couple weeks...). Instead, our current CEO is running Google like how we tried to enter social media with Google+... and I suspect this will end worse (but we'll see).",MORE,Helpful (1),Share on Facebook,Share on Twitter,Share URL,REPORT,More Menu,,,,,,,,,
